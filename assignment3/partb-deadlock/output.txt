Example of state log when deadlock occurs
READY = process is ready, waiting for input
S.WAIT = semahpore waiting
S.RELEASE = semaphore release
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCESS   STATE
ATM1      READY
ATM2      READY
DBSERVER  READY
DBEDITOR  READY
INTEREST  READY
ATM1      S.WAIT       <- waiting in semaphore queue
ATM1      PROCESSING   <- locks all other processes from accessing the DB
ATM2      S.WAIT
DBSERVER  PROCESSING   <- processing request from ATM1
INTEREST  S.WAIT       <- waiting in semaphore queue
DBEDITOR  S.WAIT       <- waiting in semaphore queue
ATM1      S.RELEASE      <- NO OTHER PROCESSES WERE ABLE TO RUN UNTIL THIS POINT
DBSERVER  READY         <- waitng for instructions
ATM2      PROCESSING
DBSERVER  PROCESSING
